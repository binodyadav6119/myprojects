When there is superclass and multiple subclasses and we want to get object of subclasses based on input and requirement.

Then we create factory class which takes the responsibility of creating object of class based on input.


Advantages:
<br>
1. Focus on creating object for interface rather than implementation.
2. Loose coupling, more robust code.

<br>

we will create a factory to get object of its child class
