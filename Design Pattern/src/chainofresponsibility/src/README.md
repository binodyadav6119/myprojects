Use case of this Pattern:
<br>
1)Design ATM
<br>
2)Design Vending MAchine
<br>
3)Design Logger(Amazon)

<br>

sender--->reciever1---->reciever2--->reciever3

sender as a client requests something from recvr1 but if rcvr1 doesnt have it then it send the request to rcvr2 and so on.


example of logger
it checks if logger type is debug then go to debugger
